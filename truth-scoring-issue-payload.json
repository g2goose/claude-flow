  "body": "# Truth Scoring Pipeline Infrastructure Failure Investigation\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe Truth Scoring Pipeline workflow (`.github/workflows/truth-scoring.yml`) is consistently failing with a score of 62.6/100, well below the required 85% threshold. This investigation reveals critical infrastructure failures that need immediate attention.\n\n## Investigation Results\n\n### Critical Finding: Test Coverage Infrastructure Collapse\n\nThe primary blocker is a **complete test coverage infrastructure failure**:\n\n- **Test Coverage Score: 0.0/100** (25% weight) - Critical failure\n- **210 test failures** out of 476 total tests (44% failure rate)\n- Coverage artifacts not generated (`coverage/coverage-summary.json` missing)\n- `npm run test:coverage` command failing to produce usable data\n\n### Secondary Issues Identified\n\n1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: 671 errors across 95 files affecting code quality scoring (currently 65.0/100)\n2. **Test Infrastructure Problems**: Module import failures, syntax errors, Jest configuration misalignment\n3. **Verification System Integration**: Cross-agent verification tests failing, evidence validation broken\n\n## Truth Score Breakdown Analysis\n\n| Component | Current Score | Weight | Status |\n|-----------|---------------|--------|---------|\n| Code Quality | 65.0/100 | 35% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below target |\n| **Test Coverage** | **0.0/100** | **25%** | üö® **Critical failure** |\n| Performance | 100.0/100 | 25% | ‚úÖ Excellent |\n| Documentation | 99.0/100 | 15% | ‚úÖ Excellent |\n\n**Final Score**: 62.6/100 ‚ùå (Threshold: 85)\n\n## Key Action Items\n\n### üö® Fix Test Coverage Infrastructure - Primary blocker (0% coverage)\n- Investigate why `npm run test:coverage` fails to generate coverage artifacts\n- Fix Jest configuration issues preventing coverage generation\n- Resolve the 210 failing tests (44% failure rate)\n- Ensure `coverage/coverage-summary.json` is properly generated\n\n### ‚ö†Ô∏è Resolve TypeScript Compilation Issues - 671 errors affecting code quality\n- Address compilation errors across 95 files\n- Fix import/export inconsistencies\n- Resolve type definition conflicts\n- Improve TypeScript configuration\n\n### üîÑ Verification Pipeline Integration - Cross-agent tests failing\n- Fix cross-agent verification test failures\n- Resolve evidence validation system issues\n- Ensure verification system components work together\n- Test integration between verification modules\n\n### üõ†Ô∏è Test Infrastructure Modernization - Import/syntax errors in tests\n- Fix module import failures in test files\n- Resolve Jest configuration misalignment\n- Address syntax errors preventing test execution\n- Modernize test infrastructure for reliability\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis infrastructure failure blocks:\n- Quality assurance processes\n- Reliable CI/CD pipeline operation\n- Code confidence scoring\n- Development velocity (failing tests block PRs)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- **Test Coverage**: Achieve minimum 75% coverage (currently 0%)\n- **Truth Score**: Reach 85+ overall score (currently 62.6)\n- **Test Failures**: Reduce to under 5% failure rate (currently 44%)\n- **TypeScript**: Zero compilation errors in CI\n- **Coverage Artifacts**: Reliable generation of coverage reports\n\n## Priority Justification\n\nUpgraded to **HIGH** priority due to:\n- Complete infrastructure collapse (0% test coverage)\n- High test failure rate (44%)\n- Blocking development workflow\n- Preventing accurate quality assessment\n\n---\n\nThis investigation provides comprehensive details for systematically addressing the truth scoring pipeline failures, starting with the critical test coverage infrastructure that's preventing accurate quality assessment.",
