# Agentic Flow Directory

This directory contains agentic workflow systems and flow management components for the Claude-Flow AI orchestration platform.

## Overview

The agentic-flow directory implements autonomous agent workflows, decision-making patterns, and self-organizing coordination systems that enable agents to operate independently while maintaining overall system coherence.

## Key Features

### Autonomous Decision Making
- **Self-Directed Workflows**: Agents make autonomous decisions within defined boundaries
- **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Agents pursue objectives with minimal human intervention
- **Adaptive Planning**: Dynamic adjustment of plans based on real-time conditions
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent allocation and optimization of computational resources

### Flow Management
- **Workflow Definition**: Declarative workflow specifications using YAML/JSON
- **State Management**: Persistent workflow state across agent interactions
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reactive workflows triggered by system events
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic error handling and workflow continuation

### Agent Coordination
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct agent-to-agent coordination protocols
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Democratic decision-making for multi-agent scenarios
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic distribution of work across available agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent resolution of competing agent objectives

## Configuration

### Workflow Definition
```yaml
# Example workflow definition
name: "feature-development"
version: "1.0"
agents:
  - role: "architect"
    capabilities: ["design", "planning"]
  - role: "developer"
    capabilities: ["coding", "testing"]
  - role: "reviewer"
    capabilities: ["analysis", "validation"]
flows:
  - name: "design-phase"
    agent: "architect"
    outputs: ["technical-spec", "architecture-diagram"]
  - name: "implementation-phase"
    agent: "developer"
    inputs: ["technical-spec"]
    outputs: ["code", "tests"]
  - name: "review-phase"
    agent: "reviewer"
    inputs: ["code", "tests"]
    outputs: ["approval", "feedback"]
```

### Agent Configuration
```json
{
  "agent": {
    "role": "developer",
    "capabilities": [
      "typescript",
      "react",
      "node.js",
      "testing",
      "debugging"
    ],
    "autonomy_level": "high",
    "coordination_style": "collaborative",
    "decision_threshold": 0.8
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Create Workflow
```bash
# Create new agentic workflow
npx claude-flow@alpha agentic create-workflow \
  --template development \
  --name "feature-auth" \
  --agents 3

# Run existing workflow
npx claude-flow@alpha agentic run-workflow \
  --workflow feature-development \
  --input "requirements.md"
```

### Monitor Flows
```bash
# View active flows
npx claude-flow@alpha agentic list-flows

# Monitor specific flow
npx claude-flow@alpha agentic monitor-flow --id flow-12345

# View flow logs
npx claude-flow@alpha agentic logs --flow flow-12345
```
