# GitHub Issue: Truth Scoring Pipeline Infrastructure Failure

## Issue Details

**Title**: [HIGH] Truth Scoring Pipeline failing due to test coverage infrastructure collapse

**Labels**: `bug`, `high-priority`, `verification`, `truth-scoring`, `test-infrastructure`

**Assignee**: @copilot

**Priority**: HIGH (upgraded from medium due to severity)

---

## Problem Description

The Truth Scoring Pipeline workflow (`.github/workflows/truth-scoring.yml`) is consistently failing with a score of 62.6/100, well below the required 85% threshold. This investigation reveals critical infrastructure failures that need immediate attention.

## Investigation Results

### Critical Finding: Test Coverage Infrastructure Collapse

The primary blocker is a **complete test coverage infrastructure failure**:

- **Test Coverage Score: 0.0/100** (25% weight) - Critical failure
- **210 test failures** out of 476 total tests (44% failure rate)
- Coverage artifacts not generated (`coverage/coverage-summary.json` missing)
- `npm run test:coverage` command failing to produce usable data

### Secondary Issues Identified

1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**: 671 errors across 95 files affecting code quality scoring (currently 65.0/100)
2. **Test Infrastructure Problems**: Module import failures, syntax errors, Jest configuration misalignment  
3. **Verification System Integration**: Cross-agent verification tests failing, evidence validation broken

## Truth Score Breakdown Analysis

| Component | Current Score | Weight | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Code Quality | 65.0/100 | 35% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below target |
| **Test Coverage** | **0.0/100** | **25%** | üö® **Critical failure** |
| Performance | 100.0/100 | 25% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Documentation | 99.0/100 | 15% | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Final Score**: 62.6/100 ‚ùå (Threshold: 85)

## Key Action Items (4-Tier Prioritized Plan)

### üö® TIER 1: Fix Test Coverage Infrastructure - Primary blocker (0% coverage)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Immediate action required

- Investigate why `npm run test:coverage` fails to generate coverage artifacts
- Fix Jest configuration issues preventing coverage generation
- Resolve the 210 failing tests (44% failure rate)  
- Ensure `coverage/coverage-summary.json` is properly generated
- Target: Achieve minimum 75% test coverage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TIER 2: Resolve TypeScript Compilation Issues - 671 errors affecting code quality
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocking code quality scoring

- Address compilation errors across 95 files
- Fix import/export inconsistencies
- Resolve type definition conflicts
- Improve TypeScript configuration
- Target: Zero compilation errors in CI

### üîÑ TIER 3: Verification Pipeline Integration - Cross-agent tests failing  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - System integration issues

- Fix cross-agent verification test failures
- Resolve evidence validation system issues
- Ensure verification system components work together
- Test integration between verification modules

### üõ†Ô∏è TIER 4: Test Infrastructure Modernization - Import/syntax errors in tests
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Infrastructure improvements

- Fix module import failures in test files
- Resolve Jest configuration misalignment
- Address syntax errors preventing test execution
- Modernize test infrastructure for reliability

## Impact Assessment

This infrastructure failure blocks:
- Quality assurance processes
- Reliable CI/CD pipeline operation  
- Code confidence scoring
- Development velocity (failing tests block PRs)

## Success Criteria & Target Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Achieve minimum 75% coverage (currently 0.0%)
- **Truth Score**: Reach 85+ overall score (currently 62.6/100)
- **Test Failures**: Reduce to under 5% failure rate (currently 44%)
- **TypeScript**: Zero compilation errors in CI
- **Coverage Artifacts**: Reliable generation of coverage reports

## Technical Debugging Steps

### Immediate Investigation Required

1. **Test Coverage System**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/claude-flow
   npm run test:coverage        # Check if command fails
   ls -la coverage/            # Verify coverage directory
   cat coverage/coverage-summary.json || echo "File missing"
   ```

2. **Jest Configuration Analysis**:
   ```bash
   npx jest --showConfig        # Display current Jest config
   npm run test -- --verbose   # Run tests with detailed output
   ```

3. **TypeScript Compilation Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck           # Check TypeScript errors
   npx tsc --noEmit --listFiles # List compilation issues
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage infrastructure restored and functional
- [ ] Coverage artifacts (`coverage/coverage-summary.json`) generated successfully
- [ ] Test failure rate reduced from 44% to under 5%
- [ ] Truth Scoring Pipeline score improved from 62.6 to 85+
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline stability restored

**Priority**: HIGH - Critical infrastructure failure blocking development workflow

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours for systematic resolution across all tiers
