## Quick Reference

### Development Commands
```bash
# Build the entire project
npm run build

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Execute tests
npm run test

# Lint source code
npm run lint
```

### Key Entry Points
- **Main CLI**: `cli/index.js` - Primary command-line interface
- **API Server**: `api/server.js` - REST API server
- **MCP Server**: `mcp/server.js` - Model Context Protocol server
- **Core Engine**: `core/orchestrator.js` - Main orchestration engine

### Architecture Patterns
- **Modular Design**: Each directory represents a bounded context
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected via configuration
- **Event-Driven**: Components communicate via events and messages
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible via plugin system

### Code Organization
- **Interfaces**: TypeScript interfaces in `types/` directory
- **Configuration**: Environment configs in `config/` directory
- **Utilities**: Shared utilities in `utils/` directory
- **Constants**: System constants in `constants/` directory
